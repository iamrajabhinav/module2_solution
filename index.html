It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species.</p></div>

It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar.</p></div>

  </div><p>Leopards are large cats, with light-colored fur, and black spots and rosettes across their entire body. The rosettes look somewhat like hollowed-out spots, and are smaller than those of the jaguar. Males of the species are larger than the females, and can stand up to 28 inches.</p></div>
